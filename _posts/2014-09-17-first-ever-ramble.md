title: First Ever Ramble
---

I'm starting this blog as a bit of a diary for problems and solutions that I may run into while developing software. We all run into certain issues when learning a new language that we run into a lot and sometimes it's easier to overcome these issues when you have a quick way to refer to the solution, this is my public notebook in that respect.

I don't expect this to become very popular and this is going to be just me spouting my thoughts onto a page so forgive me if I ramble a bit. This will also be a perfect way for me to improve my writing skills.

I will be implementing a comment section eventually but until I get around to doing that please feel free to send me an email if you have any questions about any posts I make (but please remember to link the post in the email).
